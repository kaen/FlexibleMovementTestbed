# FlexibleMovementTestbed

A simple playground for `FlexibleMovement`.

Run this as the gameplay module with the `PhysicsRoomWorldGenerator`. There's a flower-shaped thing in your inventory, 
when you right click it sets the path target for the deer to your position or the block outlined in black.

You can spawn more deer by looking at the prefabs in this module and using the `spawnPrefab` console command.
